Hi there, this is Matias and I'm 25! I'm married for almost 3 years now and I'm pursuing my Bachelor's Degree applied to technology at BYU-I Online. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I love to play soccer and Ping-Pong along with learning new languages. I speak Portuguese and English besides Spanish! That's why I love Brazilian food, and my personal one is Pizza with ''chicken and catupiry''.
